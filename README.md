## ‚öôÔ∏è Important Development Configuration

* **`next.config.js`:** Ensure the `res.cloudinary.com` domain is added to the `images.domains` section for images to display correctly. Also, make sure the `rewrites` rule for `/api` is configured to proxy requests to your backend.
* **`src/utils/axiosInstance.js`:** Verify that the `baseURL` is set to `/api` for proper communication between the Next.js frontend and the backend.
